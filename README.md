# Hi!

I'm Cath, an undergrad at Oxford studying Mathematics. I do AI safety research (technical, governance), and I like making cute websites:)

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C, R, SQL
- **ML Frameworks:** Pytorch, scikit-learn
- **LLM Ecosystem:** Hugging Face Transformers, TRL
- **Web:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, Docker, AWS

## Research
My primary research interests lie in AI control and agent foundations, particularly understanding and mitigating misalignment risks in increasingly autonomous systems. I focus on empirical and theoretical questions around goal misgeneralisation, adversarial capability elicitation, and attack selection in agentic evaluations, aiming to clarify failure modes in frontier models. I am also interested in how these technical insights inform governance design, especially mechanisms for managing strategic risk and constraining dangerous capability deployment.
